# usc-cosmolab-hackspace

Materials from USC CosmoLab weekly meetings live here.

Meetings have roughly three parts: Hacks, News, and Physics. 

In Spring 2020, the focus is on Hacks, with the main objective to provide astro grads, undergrads, and postdocs with computer-based tools for research. The group's collaborative hack project this semester is analysis of Lyman-alpha data to produce constraints on dark matter interactions with protons.

In 2021, we're continuing with research updates and hacks, wih reviews of recent papers. We're working on creating documentation on using USC computing cluster, installing and using cobaya and cosmological likelihoods, and some other python-related things for beginning students.

Meeting policy: CosmoLab is a safe learning space for cosmologists at USC to ask questions and to collaboratively think about the big problems in physics. Competition and judgement should be left for other venues; curiosity, critical thinking, and collegiality are welcome.
