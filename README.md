# usc-cosmolab-hackspace

Materials from USC CosmoLab weekly meetings live here.

Meetings have roughly three parts: Hacks, News, and Physics. 

Our values: CosmoLab is a safe learning space for cosmologists at USC to ask questions and to collaboratively think about the big problems in physics. Competition and judgement should be left for other venues; curiosity, critical thinking, and collegiality are welcome.
