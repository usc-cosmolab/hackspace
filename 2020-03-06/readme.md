# CosmoLab meeting: 01/24/20

Attending: Vera Gluscevic, Tim Morton, Siavash Yasini, Jack Lashner, Anna Haynie, Remy Gerras, Christian Glover, David Nguyen, Brenda Zhou, Resherle Verna, Jack Lashner. 

## Anna Haynie gave a short talk on her work on core-collapse supernovae; we then resumed with hacks. Tim recommended to use one of three sampler: cobaya, emcee, or pymc3, to sample alpha beta gamma parameters of Lya data. Folks are not working either on implementing the sampler (everyone is invited to write their own sampling implementation), or on resolving the test failures for our joint lya pipeline.
